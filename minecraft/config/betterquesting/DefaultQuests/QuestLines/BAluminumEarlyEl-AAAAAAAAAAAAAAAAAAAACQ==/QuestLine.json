Once you get the electrolyzer you can start the process to get your first aluminium.\n\nAs of GT6 version 6.14.24, Aluminum processing no longer requires a smelter.  In addition aluminum is a requirement in the processing of Niobium and aluminum is required to get a MV Electrolyzer to process Tantalite.  So aluminum is now a requirement before tungsten.  Aluminum is also needed to make useful itemes including filters and Aluminum is also required to progress further into the electrical age.",
