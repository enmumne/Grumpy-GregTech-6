      "desc:8": "I hope you made that stainless steel automation system, because otherwise this will feel very grindy.\nTo process oil into all types of different fuels and other side products we need a distillation tower.\n\nWhy would we do such an insane expensive project? Glad you asked. Not only do we get much more Energy out of the process than we spent, we also get some important side products that are required to make plastics, and plastic means circuits. Still not interested?\n\nThe 9 Heat Transmitters go on the bottom and will sit just above your burning boxes of choice.  Next Put the controller in the middle of one side above the Heat Transmitters and then fill in a bottom layer of Distillation parts to make the bottom of the distillation tower.  Next continue to add 9 distillation parts to build each layer of the tower until you have 8 layers above the Heat Transmitters.\n\nThe amount of burning boxes you need will depend of the oil that you are using.  Fox example Heavy Oil needs 64 HU/t.  You will get different proportions of the byproducts depending on the type of oil you process in the distillation tower.\nÂ§a\nTo complete this quest you will need to craft:\n9 Heat Transmitters\n71 Distillation Parts\n1 Distillation Tower Controller"
