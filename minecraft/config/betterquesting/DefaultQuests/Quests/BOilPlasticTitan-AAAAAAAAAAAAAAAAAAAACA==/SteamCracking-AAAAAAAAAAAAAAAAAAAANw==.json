      "desc:8": "Now that we have Butane and Propane lets further refine that to make ethylene and propolene.  The cracker has 2 recipes that use steam along with the Butane or Propane to create the Ethylene, Propylene, Methane, and Hydrogen.\n\nYou will need a burning box for the cracker.  You will also need a burning box and boiler for the steam.  Given the speed of the cracker, a invar burning box and lead steam boiler will make just a little more than the cracker with an invar burning box would use.  Upgrading to a better burning box will use the steam faster than it can be created at least if it have enough Butane or Propane.  Just pile the steam and the Butane/Propane into the left of top of the cracker.  The outputs will come out of the right by default.\n§c\n\nCareful: The steam cracker can only hold 2000L of steam, so make sure your boiler doesn\u0027t blow up.  You can use a gib-o-meter and piston to shut off the burning box or you can use a pressure valve to let out the over pressurized steam.  Once you get to circuits and electricity, you can replace the burning box with a heater that can shut off when needed.\n§a§a\n§f§aTo complete this quest craft:\n1 Steam Cracker\n1 Lead Steam Boiler\nInvar burning box for boiler\nInvar burning box or better for cracker"
