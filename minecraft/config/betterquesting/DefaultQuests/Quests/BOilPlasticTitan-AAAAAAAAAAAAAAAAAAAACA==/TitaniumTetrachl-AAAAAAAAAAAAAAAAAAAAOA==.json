      "desc:8": "There are several recipes that can be used to create the Titanium Tetrachloride.  One can be used as an efficient closed loop for the chlorine and can be used for your Titanium processing.\n\nYou can use Rutile with some carbon (coal coke or petroleum coke also work) along with molten calcium and chlorine gas will get you some titanium Tetrachloride along with some carbon dioxide.\n§b\nNote: You can see other recipes to get Titanium Tetrachloride but using Rutile is easier and you do not loose the chlorine.  You loose the chlorine with processing the Ilmenite.\n\n§fYou can get the calcite from calcite dusts that you get as byproducts of some of your ore processing.  You can also get calcite from limestone and marble dusts.  You can use a smelter to make the molten calcite.  If you have not yet have tungsten, you can use your crucible to make the molten calcite.\n§c§6§e\nWarning:  Titanium Tetrachloride is acidic!  You need ot use pipes that can handle acids such as stainless steel or gold pipes.\n\n§6Processing Recipes:\n1 Rutile + 1 Carbon (2 small coke) + 144L Molten Calcite + 4000L Chlorine \u003d\u003e [Burner Mixer 16 RU/t] \u003d\u003e 5000L Titanium Tetrachloride + 3000L CO2\n2 Rutile + 1 coke (Petrolium or coal} + 288L Molten Calcite + 8000L Chlorine \u003d\u003e [Burner Mixer 16 RU/t] \u003d\u003e 10,000L Titanium Tetrachloride + 6000L CO2\n§a\nTo complete this quest gather in a drum:\n1000L of Titanium Tetrachloride"
