Well those don\u0027t work because Greg has a nozzle and a cap nozzle.  Nozzles can be made from steel, plastic, stainless steel, along with some higher tier materials.  For this quest we will make a stainless steel nozzle and cap nozzle since they can handle acids along with other fluids.  The biggest advantage is nozzles can handle gasses while the funnel and tap can only do fluids.  The nozzle is like a tab (take fluids out) and the cap nozzle acts like a funnel (put fluids in).\n§b\nTip:  If you are running a recipe that outputs gasses and you have not yet put that gas in a storage tank, you can put a nozzle on the machine and use either an appropriate drum or Barometer Gas Cylinder to extract out the gas.\n§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n1 Stainless Steel Nozzle\n1 Stainless Steel Cap Nozzle"
