You can also get alumina from centrifuging sapphire purified ores.\n\nLook for the following:\n\n- Bauxite ore.  This would be a layered rock type similar to coal, lignite, and milky quartz.\n\n- Sapphire ores.  An alternate way to get alumina dusts.\n\n- You will need some silicon dioxide.  You can use Milky Quartz, Nether Quartz, Certus Quartz, or you left over flint dust.\n\n§e§e\nWarning:  Alumina melts at 2345K so you are likely to melt your ceramic crucible if you throw alumina in there.\n\n§b§6\nProcessing Path:\n\nAlumina dusts + Hexafluorosilicic Acid -\u003e [ Mixer ] -\u003e Molten Aluminum Fluoride + water + Silicon Dioxide\n\nAlumina dusts + Molten Aluminum Fluoride -\u003e [ LV Electrolyzer ] -\u003e Aluminum"
