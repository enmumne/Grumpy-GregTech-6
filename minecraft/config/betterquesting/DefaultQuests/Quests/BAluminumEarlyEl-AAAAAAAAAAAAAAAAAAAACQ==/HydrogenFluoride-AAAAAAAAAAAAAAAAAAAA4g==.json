You will need to pipe the Hydrogen Fluoride to the next quest to continue the process.\n§a§6\nThe recipe:\n3 Fluorite Dusts (any color) + 7000L Sulfuric Acid \u003d\u003e [Mixer 16/RU/t] \u003d\u003e 6 Calcium Sulfacte Dusts + 4000L Hydrogen Sulfide.\n§a§f§6§a\nTo complete the quest colelect in a drum:\n1000L of Hydrogen Fluoride\n§9§b\nNote:  You cannot collect Hydrogen Fluoride with a bucket, you need to use a drum.  You can empty the fluid from the drum into the mixer for the next two quests."
