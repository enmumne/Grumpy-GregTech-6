You will need to pipe the Hydrogen Fluoride to the next quest to continue the process.\n§a§6\nThe recipe:\n3 Fluorite Dusts (any color) + 7000L Sulfuric Acid \u003d\u003e [Mixer 16/RU/t] \u003d\u003e 6 Calcium Sulfate Dusts + 4000L Hydrogen Sulfide.\n§a§f§6§a\nTo complete the quest collect in a drum:\n1000L of Hydrogen Fluoride\n§9§b\nNote:  You cannot collect Hydrogen Fluoride with a bucket, you need to use a drum.  After collecting the Hydrogen Fluoride in a drum, you can place the drum on top of the next mixer to empty the fluid from the drum into the mixer for the next two quests.  You will need to use a Monkey Wrench on the drum to set it to fill adjacent storages."
