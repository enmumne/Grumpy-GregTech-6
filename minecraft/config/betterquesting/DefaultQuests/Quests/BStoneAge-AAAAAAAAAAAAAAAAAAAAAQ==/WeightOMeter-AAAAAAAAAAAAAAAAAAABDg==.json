      "desc:8": "Now that you made a thermometer sensor, there are some really useful sensors that you will need for future automation.  The Next one is a Weight-O-Meter.  This sensor measures the weight of the intems in some inventory such as the crucible or tank.  It can be used to set a redstone signal when the weight is exactly zero (i.e. it is empty).  The redstone can be connected to a hopper to drop items back in the crucible.  This is how you set up automated smelting using the crucible.  A combination of thermometer sensor to shut off hte burning box and to start pouring into the molds and a weight-o-meter to drop new items into the crucible.\n§6§e§b\nPro Tip:  View one of Bear\u0027s many automating videos to see how you can set up auto iron, bronze, brass, steel, and stainless steel using these items.\n§f\nFor now lets make a light version of the weight-o-meter as we only needc it to read zero.  You only need 2 double tin alloy plates, 4 red alloy fine wire, a wooden pressure plate, and 2 tin alloy bolts.  Don\u0027t worry that the sensor uses a wood plate, it won\u0027t burn up even if on the side of a crucible.\n§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n1 Light Weight-O-Meter \n       -or-\n1 Medium Weight-O-Meter"
