      "desc:8": "Now is the time to make some additional tools that are needed to get you through the stone age and beyond.  You will need to make a saw so you can cut rods and wood.  You will need a screwdriver to assemble anything that contains a screw.  You should have a handy set of pincers to quickly take intems out of your molds without burning yourself to death.  It also allows you to use your liquid metal before is solidifies in your crucible.  A soft hammer will be useful when making items out of wood like your first pipes.  Finally a pair of wire cutters will be useful to make some wire for machines and dealing with redstone alloy wires needed for automation.\n§e\nWarning:  You will need to make a hand drill in order to craft a soft hammer head from wood.  An early game hand drill is made from 3 sticks (any wood) and a metal arrow head and 2 metal bolts.  The arrow head and bolts need to be made from the same material.  You can pour the arrow head and bolts from using your crucible and pouring into molds.  Bronze will work so can lead.\n§d§b\nPro Tip:  You can make a mold of your saw and screwdriver using the tool and a clay mold.  If you use the completed tool, the tool wil ltake some durability damage but will not be consumed.  If you use just hte tool head, it will be comsumed when making a mold.  There are no molds for the pincers, soft hamer, and wire cutters.\n§f§a\nSo we are going to make:\n1 Saw\n1 Screwdriver\n1 Set of Pincers\n1 Hand Drill\n1 Soft Hammer\n1 Wire Cutters"
