It is best to grab the small ores and save the big ones for once you get a better fortune pick but if you need it, you need it.\n\n- Wood\n\n- Villages and their fine loot\n\n- Some food source (strawberries or berry bushes are great)\n\n- If you can find a cauldron somewhere, grab it, if you wash your ores before melting them, not only do you not have to deal with the stone scraps every time, you also get some extra side products as a bonus!\n\n- Look for some gravel as we will be needing some flint soon.\n\n- Finally look for a nice place to settle down or at least a starting base so you and dump off resources.\n\n- Start gathering rocks in order to look for ore veins and to gathering rocks for tools.\n\n- Some ore veins you could use are Copper/Tetrahydrate, Tin/Cassiterite, and Redstone/Cinnabar and Granitic Sand.",
