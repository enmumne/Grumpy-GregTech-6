      "desc:8": "If you made to the crucible using the new method of the brick burning box, then you are going to need some tools so that you can make some machine and progress.  If you used the old harder way to get to the crucible, then you can just submit the tools that you already made and get another cookie for your hard work.\n\nSo what tools are you going to need.?  Well you are going to need a hammer, file, and wrench.  Yoiu can make your tools out of almost any metal or alloy.  At this point in GT6, your best materials are lead and bronze.  You can use NEI to look at the durability of each metal and alloy.  There are better materials than others.  Fox example, copper is very poor material for tools since the tools won\u0027t last beyond a use or two.\n\nTo make a metal hammer, you will need a stone hammer.  A stone hammer is just 6 rocks and a stick.  For the metal hammer, you take 6 ingots and your stone hammer to make a hammer head.  Use then combine your hammer head and a stick in a crafting grid to make the hammer.  It is similar with a file, combine a file head and a stick.  The wrench is 4 plates and a hammer.\n§b\nPro Tip:  You can make some tool molds for some tools like the hammer, file, pick, axe, etc.  More complex tools like a wrench, monkey wrench, wire cutters, or pinchers cannot be made through a mold.  The key is to make a full tool with a stick before you combine the tool with the mold in a crafting grid.  If you combine a mold and a tool head, you will lose the tool head but if you combine a full tool and a mold, you will only use a little bit of the tool durability and now you can pour you tool heads right from the crucible.  The tool molds will produce raw tool heads.  You will need to use a file to make a tool head from the raw tool heads oryou can use a grindstone once you make some iron.\n§f§a\nTo complete this quest make the following tools:\n1 Hammer\n1 File\n1 Wrench"
