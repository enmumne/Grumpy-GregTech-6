      "desc:8": "Clay molds should be the first molds for you to make. You can reuse them and they can take quite some temperature (up to 2,500 deg K).  You will need your knife and a rolling pin and some clay to make the blank molds.\n\nNote: The old way you would cook the raw clay molds in a furnace and then use a chisel to chip out the right pattern into the baked blank molds.  You can still do this if you want but there is a much better way.  You can now define the pattern beforehand in the raw clay mold then cook that mold in a furnace.  No chisel needed.\n\nTo demonstrate the technique, make a plate mold, and a pickaxe mold.  The other 2 blank molds are up to you.  Then put your pattern raw clay molds in a furnace to create the ready to use ceramic molds.  You have quite a few options for the other molds, you can make an ingot mold, rod mold, sword, shovel, and even a hammer mold.  It is all up to you to decide what you want to make.\n§b\nNote:  Be aware that metal molds do not come with a predefined pattern and you have to chisel those in world (but you do not have to worry about that for now)!\n§c§d§b\nPro Tip:  You can use a clay brick for an ingot, a stick for a rod, some wood planks for plates, and a wooden or flint pickaxe for the pick axe mold.  The basic items will be consumed.  Also when making other molds from your metal tools (Axe, File, Hammer, etc) if you use a full tool (the tool head with a handle) instead of just the tool head, the tool will take duribility.  If you use just the tool heads, they will be consumed in the crafting process.\n§f§a\nCraft the following items:\n1 Rolling pin\n1 Plate Clay Mold\n1 Pick Axe Clay Mold\n\nCook the 2 molds in a furnace to get:\n1 Mold (Produces Plates)\n1 Mold (Produces Pickaxe Heads)"
