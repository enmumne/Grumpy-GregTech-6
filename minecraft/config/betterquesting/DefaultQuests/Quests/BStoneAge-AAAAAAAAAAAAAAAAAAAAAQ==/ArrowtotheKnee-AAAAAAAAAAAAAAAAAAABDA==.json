      "desc:8": "You will need a metal arrowhead very soon to make a specific tool.  The issue is you will need to make a mold to make a arrow head.  The quickest way is you can make flint arrowheads by using a rock and flint in a crafting grid (makes 4 flint arrowheads) or a file and flint (6 flint arrowheads).  You can then make a clay mold and combine one of the arrowheads with the mold to make a clay raw arrowhead and then cooking it in a furnace.\n\nSo what do you do with the flint arrowheads?  You can make arrows by combining a headless wood arrow with the flint arrowheads to make flint arrows.  You will get headless wood arrows as drops from skeletons or by putting sticks and feathers in a crafting grid.\n§c\nWarning:  Do not use flint arrows on Creepers.  As soon as a creeper ignites, the fuse also ignites and the creeper will explode.  This also occurs if you use a flint and tender on a creeper.  So unless you are planning to use explosive mining, I would not recommend using flint arrows on creepers.  \n§b\nNote:  Flint knife, pickaxe, and axe will not ignite the creeper fuse but it will just start the creeper on fire.\n§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n1 Flint Arrowhead\n1 Ceramic Arrowhead Mold\n"
