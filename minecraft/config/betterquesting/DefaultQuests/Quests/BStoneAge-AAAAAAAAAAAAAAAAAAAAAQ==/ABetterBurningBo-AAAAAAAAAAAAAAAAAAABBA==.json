      "desc:8": "As you probably have found out that the Brick Burning Box is very very inefficient.  Now that we have some Bronze, lets make a better burning box so you can save some of your fuel and also some time watching metal melt.  You will be making quite a few of these so let get started with the first one.  \n§b\nNote: As of Gregtech 6.16.02, Greg has added Arsenic alloys as early tech items.  Arsenic is a byproduct from washing copper and tetra once you have a cauldron.  A Bronze burning box has an efficiency of 75% and an output of 24 HU/t.  A Arsenic Copper burning box is 80% efficient and has an output of 24 HU/t.  Finally a Arsenic Bronze burning box is 90% efficient and 28 HU/t.  In other words you get more heat out of the same amount of fuel.\n§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n1 Bronze Burning Box (Solid)\n-or-\n1 Arsenic Copper Burning Box (Solid)\n-or-\n1 Arsenic Bronze Burning Box (Solid)\n\n",
