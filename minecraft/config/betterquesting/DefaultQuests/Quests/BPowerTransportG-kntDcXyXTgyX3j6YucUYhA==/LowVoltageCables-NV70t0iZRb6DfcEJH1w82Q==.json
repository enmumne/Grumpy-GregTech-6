      "desc:8": "The wires and cables for Low Voltage (LV) are made from lead.  The wire are exposed so you can get shocked and damage yourself so you will want to insulate the wires using rubber.  Coating a wire in rubber will make a cable.  You can make any wire from 1x to 16x but for cables only come in 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, and 16x.  For this quest you need to make either a 4x or 8x lead cables.  You will need the Laminator to coat the wires in rubber so you can get your cables.\n§b\nNote:  The number of x\u0027s is a multiplier of how many amps the cable can carry.  A lead cable can carry 1 amp, so a 8x lead cable can carry 8 amps.  All wires and cable has a loss per each cable/wire used.  Using cables reduces this loss.  You will want to use a cable that can carry enough amps to run your machines.  The capacity is determined by the number of batteries in a battery box, the number of machines being used, or both.  So using a large Battery box with 8 batteries and running 5 machines will melt your 4x cables.\n§6§e\nWarning:  There is also tin cables but they are limited as they can only handle 32 EU Voltage and most Low Voltage machines pull 64 EU Voltage.  This will melt the tin cables.  You can use tin for ULV but don\u0027t use them for LV applications\n§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n2 4x Lead Cable -OR-\n1 8X Lead Cables"
