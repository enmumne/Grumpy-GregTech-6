At this point we can only wash our crushed ores with a cauldron.  \n§b\nNote:  Washing your ores not only gives you useful byproducts, it also saves you from having to clean out stone scrap from the crucible and it increases the amount you get.  Washing your crushed ores concentrates the main ore to increase the amount of melted metal you can get in the crucible.  For example crushed copper gives 1.125 copper.  Washing the crushed copper into purified copper, you get 1.250 copper.  Once you get advanced machines to refine your copper ore you finally get 1.375 copper.\n\nYou can fill up a cauldron with water by filling it with a bucket or connecting the cauldron to your water pipe network.  You can wash the ores by throwing the crushed ores into the cauldron.\n§6§b§3\nTip: If you hook a pipe on the cauldron it can fill up automatically. But that only works if your pipe is big enough (a huge wooden or huge treated fluid pipe works)\n§c§\n§f§a\nTo complete this quest craft or find:\n1 Cauldron"
