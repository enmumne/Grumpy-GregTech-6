      "desc:8": "You will want to find a good base for your growing factory.  Make sure to build close to a renewable fresh water source, otherwise you need many pipes just to transport that water to your factory.  Only rivers give you a unlimited supply of fresh water.  Other sources like lakes will run dry.  Later you can make cheap rubber pipes, where this wont be much of a problem anymore.  The oceans are also unlimited but they contain salt water.\n\nIn the Steam Age you want to look for:\n\n- Copper, Tetrahedrite, Chalcopyrite (you will need a ton of it)  There are other copper ores but they are not as easy to extract a decent amount of copper from them using a crucible.\n\n- Tin/Cassiterite\n\n- Garnerite/Pentlandite/Cobalite (Nickel is needed for Invar and Cobalt can be used for good tier 3 tools}\n\n- Black Sand (There are 3 now:  Black Sand, Basaltic Black Sand, and Granitic Black Sand which are found in river biomes).  The black sands are needed for you to make iron in the early game with a carbon source like coal.  The other iron bearing ores such as Yellow/Brown Limonite, Hematite, and Vanilla Iron Ores require advanced processing and/or calcite to get iron from them.\n\n- Redstone so you can do automation and shutoffs.\n\n- some Pyrolusite as we will need some Manganese soon.\n\n- some Chromite\n\n\nOptional:\n\n- Rubber Trees (their sap is great to make torches and you can make glue out of it).\nÂ§b\nNote:  Our quests will show processing steps to break ores down into base elements and teach new users how to make more complex alloys that are needed for advanced recipes.  Some quests will have you make some alloys that will be needed in following quests for more complex alloys.  These quests are scattered in different tabs.  For example the Red Steel Quests in the Useful Alloys tab.  For most quests though, like the stainless steel quest, you will be asked to provide the basic elements in either dust, plate or ingot form.  Limiting the quest to base elements also reduces the complexity that would be required to have each quest to be compatible with every alloy possibility."
