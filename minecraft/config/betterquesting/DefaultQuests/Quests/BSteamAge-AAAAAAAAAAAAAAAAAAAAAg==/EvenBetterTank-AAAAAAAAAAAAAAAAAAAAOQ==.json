If you need more storage or if you need to store gasses (gasses don\u0027t work with treated wood), you will need a different tank.  This is where Invar tanks come in handy.  Small Invar tanks hold 1,728,000 liters and need the same 3x3 space as the treated wood tank.  It can also hold gasses.  There are also large versions of the tanks but they require significantly more invar to create but can hold significantly larger amounts of non-acidic fluids.\n§e\nWarning:  Invar tanks can hold gasses but not acids.  You will need stainless steel tanks for that.\n§a\nTo complete the quest craft:\n25 Invar Walls\n1 Small Invar Main Tank Valve"
