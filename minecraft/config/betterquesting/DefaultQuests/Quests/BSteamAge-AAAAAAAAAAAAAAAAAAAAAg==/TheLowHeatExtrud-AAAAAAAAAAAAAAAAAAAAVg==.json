      "desc:8": "The Extruder is a very useful machine as you can make almost every shape by melting ingots, plates, or dusts.  The low heat version can do low temperature metals (Copper, Tin, Bronze, and Brass).  You can also use the low temperature extruder for rubber and plastic shapes.  You will need a Invar or higher version for iron, steel and others.\n\nYou use a extruder plate shape to make the shape that you want.  You can make plates, curved plates, wires, cells, rods, pipes, and lots more by have the appropiate extruder plate.\n§b\nPro Tip: You can store your extruder shapes in a bookshelf placed on top of the extruder.  Just make sure the bookshelf is made of metal such as bronze, cobalt, or steel.  A wooden bookshelf will burn.  The foil and fine wire are only for wax, plastic and rubber only not metals.\n§a\nTo complete this quest:\nCraft 1 Low Heat Extruder (Steel)"
