      "desc:8": "We need some iron to start making some steam age machines.  Greg has changed how black sand works from earlier versions of GT6.  Greg added Basaltic, and Granitic Black Sand in addition to the origional Black Sand.  First you will need to convert the sand blocks into the resulting dusts which are labeled as Mineral Sand or Magnesite.  This is very easy.  Just put it into your black sand blocks in your crafting grid and pull out the 9 mineral sand dusts.  Mix some basaltic/granitic mineral sand or magnesite with a carbon source such as coal or coal coke.  You can use other ores for iron but in the case of limonite or hematite you need to add some calcite (limestone works good for that).\n§b\nPro Tip:  You can use a GT barrel and put in 1 mineral sand dust.  Now when you put in additional blocks, they will be converted to the dusts automatically.\n§6\nRecipe:\n14 Granitic/Basaltic Mineral Sand or 14 Magnesite Dust + 3 Carbon (6 Coal Dusts or 3 Coal Coke Ingots) \u003d\u003e [Crucible 1811K] \u003d\u003e 6 Iron Ingots\n-- or --\n7 Granitic/Basaltic Mineral Sand or 7 Magnesite Dusts + 1.5 Carbon  (3 Coal Dusts or 6 Small Chunks Coal Coke) \u003d\u003e [Crucible 1811K] \u003d\u003e 3 Iron Ingots\n§b\nNote:  14 Sand dusts plus 3 carbon is more than 16 items so if you use the full recipe the curcible will heat up to 1811 to crate iron and then the final items will drop dropping the temperature.  You can do a half recipe even though it is not listed in NEI.  If the crucible goes over 2011K then you will get wrought iron.  In most cases, you can use iron or wroght iron interchangeability in GT6 recipes.  Other mod recipes may or may not depending on compatibility.\n§c\nCareful: Don\u0027t use lignite coal as the carbon in the crucible, it will ignite and blow up. Use normal coal or coal coke for your carbon.  You can use Lignite coal as fuel for the burning box to keep the crucible from overheating.  Hint: 1 Coal Coke Bar (ingot) is the same as 1 carbon dust.\n§e\nWarning:  Sifting Basaltic or Granitic Mineral Sand Blocks no longer give the resulting dusts.  They will give you some nuggets though.\n§f§a\nTo complete this quest you will need:\n7 Granitic/Basaltic Sand Dusts or 3 Magnesite Dusts §b(You will need to add 3 Coal Dusts or 6 Small Coal Coke Chunks)\n§amake 3 iron/wrought iron plates using the crucible.\n§b"
