      "desc:8": "Another new alloy added in Gregtech 6.16.02 is Arsenic Bronze.  This alloy is made from 3 copper, 1 tin, and 1 arsenic.  This alloy has more damage to slimes than arsenic copper.  This alloy also has better effecency and higher heat output than bronze or arsenic copper burnign boxes.  This alloy can also be used for diesel engines with slightly higher output than the bronze diesel engiens.  This alloy can also be used for a tier 2 item pipe but has the same step size as tier 1 bronze item pipes.  This is probably an easy iter 2 as the other tier 2 item pipes require electum (silver/gold).\n§b\nNote you can create this alloy by spelting the 3 copper + 1 tin + 1 arsenic or 4 bronze + 1 arsenic or 4 arsenic copper + 1 tin.\n§a\nTo complete this quest make :\n5 Arsenic Bronze Plates"
