      "desc:8": "Now that you have a crusher up and running, you will notice that you get 2 items, crushed ore and for block ores, stone dust.  If you were thinking of automating sending the output of the crusher to the sluice, you will need to filter out the dusts.  You could put barrels along the item pipes but you would have to set it up where the item barrels were no where near your buurning boxes or else they would burn up.  Filters will become available once you have aluminium processing but that will be a while before you have the tech to deal with that.  In the early game Greg gives you a Dust Funnel.  You place the Dust Funnel below your item pipes running between the Crusher and the Sluice with additional pipes below the Dust Funel and youj can now direct the dusts away from your sluice.\n\nThe Dust Funnel is made from iron plates, iron rods, and a Vanilla Hopper.  The Vanilla Hopper is made from 5 iron plates.\nÂ§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n1 Dust Funnel"
