Here is a list of all of the types of power that exist in Gregtech 6:\n\nGU - Generic Units (just used in NEI to show recipes, the machine itself will convert any other power types 1:1 into GU to produce the recipe)\n\nEU - Electrical Units\n\nRF - Redstone Flux\n\nRU - Rotational Units (for everything that needs some spin)\n\nKU - Kinetic Units\n\nHU - Heat Units\n\nLU - Light Units (made by lasers to power welders etc)\n\nQU - Quantum Units (used by high tech machines)\n\nConverting between different energy types is not always looseless, it depends on the machines you use (always check the tooltips)\n\n\n"
