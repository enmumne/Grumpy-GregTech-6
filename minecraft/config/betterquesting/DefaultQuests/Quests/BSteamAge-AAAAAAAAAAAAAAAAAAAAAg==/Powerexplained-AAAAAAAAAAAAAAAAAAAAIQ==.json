      "desc:8": "You might have noticed that NEI shows recipes in machines with GU/t as power usage and total GU used for a recipe.\nGregTech 6 has many different power types, which can be converted between each other (for example you can use EU (electrical units) to power a motor which will produce RU (rotational units).  Here is a list of all of the types of power that exist in GregT5ech 6:\n\nGU - Generic Units (just used in NEI to show recipes, the machine itself will convert any other power types 1:1 into GU to produce the recipe)\n\nEU - Electrical Units\n\nRF - Redstone Flux\n\nRU - Rotational Units (for everything that needs some spin)\n\nKU - Kinetic Units\n\nHU - Heat Units\n\nLU - Laser Units (made by lasers to power welders etc)\n\nQU - Quantum Units (used by high tech machines)\n\nConverting between different energy types almost always have a loss (up to 50%), so try to use the appropiate enery type with as minimal conversions as possible. (always check the tooltips)\n\n\n",
