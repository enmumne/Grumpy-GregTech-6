You can craft it by hand with 8 Fine Copper Wires and your wire cutters or you can use a Precision Laser Engraver and Copper Foil.  Doing it by hand will use more copper.\n§b\nNote:  You will need to have T1 Basic Circuits to make a Laser Engraver(T1)\n§6\nCompletely by hand: Anvil Plate into 2 Foils -\u003e Cut Foil into 1 Fine Copper Wire \u003d\u003e Requires 4 Copper plates for 8 fine Copper Wire\nUse Cluster Mill:  1 Copper Plate into 4 Foils -\u003e Use Cutters to make Fine Copper Wire \u003d\u003e 2 Copper plates for 8 Fine Copper Wire\nUse Wire Mill:  1 Copper Rod wil make 4 Fine Copper Wires \u003d\u003e 1 Copper Ingot (2 Copper Rods) for 8 Fine Copper Wire\nUse Cluster Mill/Laser Engraver:  1 Copper Plate in Cluster Mill for 4 Copper Foil, 4 Copper Foil in Laser Engraver will create 1 Circuit Wiring.\n§a\nTo Complete the quest craft:\n1 Circuit Wiring (Copper)"
