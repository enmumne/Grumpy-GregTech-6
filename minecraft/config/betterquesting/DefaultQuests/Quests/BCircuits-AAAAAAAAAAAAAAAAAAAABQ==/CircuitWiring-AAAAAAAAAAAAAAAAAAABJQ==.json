      "desc:8": "Next we need some wiring for that fancy new Circuit Plate you just crafted.  All you need is some copper.  There are several ways to make the circuit wiring.  You can craft it by hand with 8 Fine Copper Wires and your wire cutters or you can use a Precision Laser Engraver and Copper Foil.  Doing it by hand will use more copper.\n§b\nNote:  You will need to have T1 Basic Circuits to make a Laser Engraver(T1)\n§6\nCompletely by hand: Anvil Plate into 2 Foils -\u003e Cut Foil into 1 Fine Copper Wire \u003d\u003e Requires 4 Copper plates for 8 fine Copper Wire\nUse Cluster Mill:  1 Copper Plate into 4 Foils -\u003e Use Cutters to make Fine Copper Wire \u003d\u003e 2 Copper plates for 8 Fine Copper Wire\nUse Wire Mill:  1 Copper Rod wil make 4 Fine Copper Wires \u003d\u003e 1 Copper Ingot (2 Copper Rods) for 8 Fine Copper Wire\nUse Cluster Mill/Laser Engraver:  1 Copper Plate in Cluster Mill for 4 Copper Foil, 4 Copper Foil in Laser Engraver will create 1 Circuit Wiring.\n§a\nTo Complete the quest craft:\n1 Circuit Wiring (Copper)",
