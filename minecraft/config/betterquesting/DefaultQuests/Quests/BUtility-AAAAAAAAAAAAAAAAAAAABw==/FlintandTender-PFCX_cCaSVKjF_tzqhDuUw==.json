      "desc:8": "Are you tired of making those single use fire starters and trying to keep enough sticks and dried grass in your inventory?  Greg has the next tier of igniter called a Flint and Tender which works similar to the Vanilla Flint and Steel.  The Flint and Tender has different amounts of durability (i.e. ignites) and chance of ignition depending on the material used.  You can use some chipped gems, cobaltite, and iron bearing rocks like hematite or cobalt and iron nuggers.  Just use NEI to see the different possibilities.\n§6\nExample:  Cobaltite Bearing Rock Flint and Tender has 100% change of ignition but only a durability of 25.  A Tiger Eye Flint and Tender has a 30% chance of ignition but a durability of 6400.\n§b\nTip:  You can use some of the otherwise useless gems like Tiger Eye, Cat\u0027s Eye, Jaspers, and Aventurine. You can put the higher tier gem on an anvil and use a hammer on the gems to break them down to lower tiers.  Just repeat until you get chipped.  You do lose some of the gems this way.\n§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n1 Flint and Tender",
