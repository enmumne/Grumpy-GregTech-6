That is why Greg has the Generifier so you can get vanilla cobble, a base wood and even the consolidate the colored fluorites.\n§b\nNote:  For a while vanilla cobble was rare in Gregtech 6.  In the more recent versions Greg added vanilla rock layers with vanilla ores to have better mod compatibility.  So you should be able to find vanilla rocks now but the generifier still has some significant uses.  You will need vanilla stone for stairs and other specific default Minecraft shapes as Greg has not added those by default.  The only other option for stairs and other special blocks is to use Carpenter\u0027s Blocks.\n§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n1 Generifier"
