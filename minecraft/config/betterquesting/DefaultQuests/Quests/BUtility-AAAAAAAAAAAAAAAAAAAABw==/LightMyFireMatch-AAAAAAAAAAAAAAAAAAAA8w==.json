Within the vein you will have ore to give you Phosphor or Phosphorus dust. You can combine one dust with 4 short sticks (saw and 1 stick in crafting grid will give 2 short sticks).  Matches give you 90% chance to have a light.  1 Dust and 4 short sticks in a diamond will give you 4 matches.\n\nFlint and Tender is single use but only 50% of lighting\nFlint and Steel has more than a single use depending on the materials used but only 30% chance of lighting\na Match is single use but 90% chance of lighting.\n\nOnce you have the dusts from processing ores, you can make a bunch of matches.  Eventually when you get a machine, you can make a box of matches that will have 64 uses at 90% chance of lighting.\nÂ§a\nTo complete the quest gather and craft:\n4 Short Sticks\n1 Phosphor or Phosphorus Dust\n4 Matches",
