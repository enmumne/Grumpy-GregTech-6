There are various materials but the easiest to get early to mid game will be Efrine.  Efrine is a tier 3 material which contains Fortuen II and Looting II enchants.  Efrine makes it a great material to use to mine ores and killing mobs.  Efrine is not found as an ore but you can get a a byproduct of washing Nether Quartz.  Nether Quarts is a white rock layer ore deposit in the nether.  If you do not have a crusher, use a hammer to get the crushed ores.\n\nTo get the best from looting mobs, make a Butchery Knife.  A Butchery Knife gives you Looting I.  Since Efrine gives Looting II, you will get a Butchery Knife with Looting III.  Now you can collect Leather and Ender pearls with ease.  You will need 4 Efrine plates, 1 efrine rod and a hammer and a file to make the Butchery Knife\n§c\nWarning:  Efrine metls at 2246K close to the temperature of the ceramic crucible at 2500K so you will want to use a fuel that does not burn very long such a Lignight nuggets (tiny dusts), or liquid or gas fuel.\n§a\nTo complete this quest gather and craft:\n4 Purified Efrine Ore\n1 Efrine Pickaxe\n1 Efrine Butchery Knife\n"
