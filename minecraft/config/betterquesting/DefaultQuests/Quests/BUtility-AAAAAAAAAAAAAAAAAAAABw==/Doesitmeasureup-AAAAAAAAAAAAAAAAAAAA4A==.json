You can also store the liquids in a ceramic jug.  The easiest measuring pot and jug is made from clay.  Just make a clay measuring pot and clay jug and then cook them in a furnace.  The only issue is you cannot store acids or hot liquids above 2,400 deg K in a ceramic jug or measuring pot.\n§b\nNote:  For acids there are stainless steel measuring pot.  You can also use stainless steel drum for acids and high tier metal drums for hotter liquids.\n§f§a\nTo complete this quest craft:\n1 clay measuring pot\n1 ceramic measuring pot (cook the clay pot in a furnace)\n1 clay jug\n1 ceramic jug (cook the clay jug in a furnace)",
